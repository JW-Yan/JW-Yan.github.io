### Welcome to Jingwen lab @ IUPUI

Our Brain Imaging and Genetics Lab is a highly interdisciplinary team led by Dr. Jingwen Yan. Dr. Yan is an Assistant Professor of BioHealth Informatics at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University (IU) School of Medicine (IUSM). Dr. Yan has extensive expertise in machine learning, network science, systems biology, visualization and web development. Much of this expertise has been applied to the challenge of understanding, diagnosing and treating complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this context, Dr. Yan’s research is focused on developing efficient and scalable computational and bioinformatics approaches for integrative analysis of high throughput multi-omic data and rich biological knowledge for discovery of biomarkers for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.
